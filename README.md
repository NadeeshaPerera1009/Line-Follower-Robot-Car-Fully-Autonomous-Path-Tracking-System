# Line-Follower-Robot-Car-Fully-Autonomous-Path-Tracking-System
The aim of this project was to design and build a fully autonomous robot capable of following a predefined black path on a white surface consisting of straight lines, curves, 90° turns, and junctions. The robot starts manually via a power switch, navigates the entire path autonomously, and stops automatically at the end point.
